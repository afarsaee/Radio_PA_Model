# Radio_PA_Model
The power amplifiers have nonlinearity, which can be modeled with different nonlinear functions.

"weblab" is used to access output data from a real power amplifier. Random data input is fed into the PA, and the output is read from "weblab". Then, a fully connected neural network is used to model the PA behaviour.
